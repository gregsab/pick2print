# pick2print
Lightroom plugin which will help you to choose photos to be printed. 

## How does it work?
This plugin _will not_ do the whole work for you. Based on the ranking (no. of stars assigned in Lightroom) it will choose the best photos. It will start from the best ranked photos and continue to the lower ranked ones. If 15 photos are still needed and currently analyzed rank contains 20 photos it will pick 15 photos randomly. Plugin does not include photos with zero stars into selection.

### Example
